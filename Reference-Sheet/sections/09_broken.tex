\section{I broke it. What now?}

It's most likely a missing bracket or a typo.
Other favourites are misspelling environment names or forgetting to include the package you want to use in your preamble.\\
For all of these cases, click the button next to the recompile button to get a list of errors. If something is broken, it'll have the number of errors with a red background on it. If the background is yellow your document should still compile fine and latex is just warning you about certain parts. It is worthwhile to have a quick look as to what is the problem. E.g. it could be that a figure could not be placed where you wanted it or only some lay-outing stuff, that has no visible impact. In most cases the warnings can be safely ignored. However, if you want to know what a warning means, or maybe something does not look right, you can search for the warning message and usually find several posts that deal with the issue.\\

Or google results that link to questions on stackexchange.
